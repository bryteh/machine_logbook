# Report Generation Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The "Failed to generate report" error was caused by **WeasyPrint** library requiring additional system libraries (GTK+) that are difficult to install on Windows.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed WeasyPrint Dependency**
- Removed `weasyprint==61.2` from `requirements.txt`
- Uninstalled weasyprint package
- Updated report generator to use only **ReportLab** (which works perfectly on Windows)

### 2. **Fixed Report Generator Code**
- Updated `issues/report_generator.py` to handle missing fields gracefully
- Fixed department and machine name references
- Added null checks for optional fields

### 3. **Created Proper Server Startup Scripts**

#### For Windows Command Prompt:
```batch
# Run this file: start_servers.bat
start_servers.bat
```

#### For PowerShell:
```powershell
# Run this file: start_servers.ps1
.\start_servers.ps1
```

#### Manual Commands (if scripts don't work):
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Django Backend
cd project\django_backend
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

# Terminal 2 - React Frontend  
cd project
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing Results
