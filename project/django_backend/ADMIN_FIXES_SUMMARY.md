# Django Admin Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: Public Access Not Editable âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: Could not edit Public Role permissions in Django Admin

**Root Cause**: Missing `has_change_permission` method in PublicRoleAdmin

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `has_change_permission` method to PublicRoleAdmin class
- Now allows editing of public permissions through Django Admin

**Location**: `issues/admin.py` - PublicRoleAdmin class

**How to Use**:
1. Go to Django Admin (`/admin/`)
2. Navigate to **Issues â†’ Public roles**
3. Click on the single PublicRole entry
4. Use the filter_horizontal widget to add/remove permissions
5. Save changes

## Issue 2: User Deletion Foreign Key Error âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: `IntegrityError` when deleting users due to foreign key constraint on UserRole table

**Root Cause**: Database constraint wasn't properly set to CASCADE deletion

**Solutions Applied**:

### 1. Database Migration (0018)
- Fixed foreign key constraint to use `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Applied SQL fix for PostgreSQL database
- File: `issues/migrations/0018_auto_20250702_0217.py`

### 2. Enhanced User Admin
- Created custom UserAdmin with proper deletion handling
- Added transaction-based deletion to prevent race conditions
- Added preview of related UserRoles that will be deleted
- File: `issues/admin.py` - CustomUserAdmin class

### 3. Cleanup Command
- Created management command to clean up any orphaned records
- Detects and fixes duplicate UserRoles, invalid references
- File: `issues/management/commands/cleanup_user_roles.py`

**How to Use**:
1. Users can now be deleted normally from Django Admin (`/admin/auth/user/`)
2. UserRole records are automatically cleaned up
3. No more foreign key constraint errors

**Manual Cleanup** (if needed):
```bash
# Check for issues
python manage.py cleanup_user_roles --dry-run

# Fix any issues found
python manage.py cleanup_user_roles --force
```

## Added Features

### 1. External Technician Name Permission
- New permission: `view_external_technician_names`
- Controls whether users see actual external technician names or "External Technician"
- Added to all existing roles except Public
- File: `issues/management/commands/setup_rbac_system.py`

### 2. Public Access Management Command
- Command to configure public user permissions via CLI
- File: `issues/management/commands/configure_public_access.py`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Show current public permissions
python manage.py configure_public_access --show

# Grant permissions
python manage.py configure_public_access --grant "view_dashboard,view_costs"

# Revoke permissions
python manage.py configure_public_access --revoke "view_costs"

# Reset to defaults
python manage.py configure_public_access --reset
```
